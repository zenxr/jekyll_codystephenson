*Please ignore the gas station food on the seat. I was stranded with a flat for a few hours*

### Backstory
My group of friends decided to go camping. That's fine. I love camping. The only issue was my wife and I only have the Mazda and my Sportster running at the moment. So, I needed to take the bike.

### Predicament
I didn't have a nice way to load camping gear onto the bike. I needed to bring:

```
1 x tent
1 x sleeping bag
1 x backpack
1 x hopes and dreams
```

I could currently bring:

```
1 x backpack
```

### In comes the Sissybar
I knew I had a small, old luggage rack that came with the sportster when I bought it. I decided to hack together a sissybar out of this luggage rack and about $10 in steel rods from Lowe's.

I used my phone to crudely draw the shape I wanted. Next, I seperated the rack from the mounts on it with my jigsaw. Then, I tacked the rods I'd cut to the mounts with my cheap Harbor Freight welder.

### To Be Improved
I need to basically rebuild it entirely.. but it held! It'll work until I get the time to dedicate a weekend to making a proper one.
