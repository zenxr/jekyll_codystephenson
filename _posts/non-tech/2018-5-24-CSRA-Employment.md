### Graduation
I've finally graduated from LA Tech with a degree in Cyber Engineering! My wife obtained her Master's in Counselling at the same time. We're ready to begin our careers!

### CSRA
For now, I've been hired to work at CSRA as a System Support Specialist level 2 for the VA. We do basic remote IT support. I'm happy here and see a bright future ahead.

Cindy is waiting on me to find out how long I'll be here before making her own career plans. If we'll likely be moving in 6 months, it'll be hard for her to start a new career and uproot right after.
