So I've finally moved over to jekyll. I've wanted to set it up for blogging for a while.

### About the set up
It's built on some pretty neat stuff.
* The page's theme, as of 11-11-17, is based on the [jekyll-doc-theme](https://github.com/aksakalli/jekyll-doc-theme). 
* The css is handled by [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).
